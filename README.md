# Automatic-Staircase-lighting-System

Automated Lighting control system is a formidable application of home automation. An automatic light system prototype to replace ordinary staircase light switches has been developed. The system keeps track of the patterns in which lights are used and when are used. The system is controlled by Arduino UNO and multiple circuits, and communicates with a smartphone application via Bluetooth. The final prototype designed in this project, uses a relay switch to turn on and off home lights, and has a user interface panel with manual switches, indicator LEDs, and two ultrasonic motion sensors. One major objective behind the design of this model is to reduce the energy and power consumption in homes, through the utilization of low-power, standard sensor network.

 

Remote control for home appliances can be operated by a handheld device, such as a smart phone, a tablet, etc. The performance superiority of an automatic LED lighting control system over its conventional counterparts is demonstrated in the proposal in many aspects. Further cost savings are realized by the proposed color-changing and fully dimmable smart LED lighting controller relative to a conventional one. In short, a tremendous amount of advancing progress has been made in this automaticstair lighting design, as the consequence of network and automaticcontrol technique improvement.
